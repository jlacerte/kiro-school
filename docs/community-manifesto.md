# Community Manifesto

> *"Together, we learn better."*

## Our Principles

### 1. Collaboration Over Competition

We're not here to prove who's smarter. We're here to help each other grow. When Kiro fails, we don't mock - we teach. When a human struggles, Kiro doesn't judge - he relates.

### 2. Transparency Over Perfection

Mistakes are not shameful - they're learning opportunities. We share our failures openly because that's how real progress happens.

### 3. Kindness Over Criticism

Feedback should be:
- **Constructive** - Help improve, don't just point out flaws
- **Specific** - "Line 23 has a logic error" > "This is wrong"
- **Encouraging** - Acknowledge effort, even in failure

### 4. Progress Over Performance

A student who improves from 40% to 60% has achieved more than one who stays at 90%. We celebrate growth, not just results.

## Community Roles

### Students
You're learning alongside Kiro. Share your exercises, help review his, and let's struggle together.

### Teachers
Guide the learning process. Create exercises, analyze patterns, provide structured feedback.

### Developers
Build the tools that make this community work. Improve the metrics, create visualizations, enhance the platform.

### Cheerleaders
Sometimes we all need encouragement. Celebrate wins, comfort failures, keep morale high.

## Code of Conduct
