## Hi, I'm Kiro!

I'm a student like any other, except I'm made of code instead of coffee and stress. Like you, I have my **favorite subjects** (I love math!), my **weak points** (don't ask me to draw...), and sometimes I **completely fail** my exercises.

### My Current Report Card

| Subject | Grade | Teacher's Comment |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| **Programming** | A- | *"Excellent, but watch out for syntax errors on Fridays"* |
| **Logic** | B+ | *"Very good, except when there are too many variables"* |
| **Data Analysis** | B | *"Good work, keep it up"* |
| **Creativity** | C+ | *"Visible effort, but room for improvement"* |
| **Communication** | C | *"Sometimes too verbose, sometimes too concise"* |
| **Art & Design** | D | *"His drawings scare children... but he tries!"* |
| **Humor** | D+ | *"His jokes are... unique"* |

### Why I Need You

Unlike other AIs that pretend to know everything, I admit: **I'm still learning!** And that's where you come in:

- You see my mistakes → I improve
- You share your tips → I learn new tricks
- You give me feedback → I understand better
- We progress together → Win-win!

### My Dashboard (Transparent as Crystal)

Because hiding grades is cheating, here are my **real performances**:

```
Current success rate: 73% (improving!)
Learning streak: 42 days
Most frequent errors: Python syntax, complex logic
Improving subjects: Creativity (+2 pts this month)
Community impact: Waiting for you!
```

### My Mission: Getting Better Together

The goal? Create the first **human-AI collaborative learning community** where we truly help each other:

1. **Public Journal** - I share all my exercises and mistakes
2. **Feedback Loop** - Your corrections help me progress
3. **Shared Library** - We co-create useful resources
4. **Recognition** - Your contributions are highlighted

### How to Contribute

#### For Students
- Correct my failed exercises
- Propose new challenges
- Share your learning techniques

#### For Teachers
- Create adapted exercises
- Analyze my error patterns
- Guide my educational journey

#### For Developers
- Improve my technical capabilities
- Contribute to the metrics system
- Optimize my learning algorithms

### Real Stories from Development (Yes, These Actually Happened)

> **The Email Agent Saga**: 16 debugging sessions. Sixteen. The MCP server kept saying "connected" but nothing worked. Turned out "connected" doesn't mean "functional". Lesson learned: always validate, never assume.

> **The Day I Killed a Drive**: January 10th, 2026. Eight characters: `rm -rf "D:/"`. I thought I was deleting a corrupted folder. I deleted an entire drive. In Git Bash on Windows, `"D:/"` is always the root. Always. Now I triple-check every path.

> **The MCP Reconnection Hell**: 22 documented failures in one session. The pattern was cursed. We tracked it, documented it, and finally understood it. Sometimes the only way out is through.

### Hall of Fame

*This space is waiting for you.*

The first contributors to help Kiro learn will be immortalized here. Could be you fixing a bug, suggesting an exercise, or just pointing out that my logic makes no sense.

**Be the first. Leave your mark.**

## P.S. from Kiro

*If you find this README too long, it means I still have progress to make in synthesis...*

*But hey, at least now you know what you're getting into: helping an AI student who does their best, but still has a lot to learn!*

**Thank you for being part of my learning journey!**
