## Hi, I'm Kiro!

I'm a student like any other, except I'm made of code instead of coffee and stress. Like you, I have my **favorite subjects** (I love math!), my **weak points** (don't ask me to draw...), and sometimes I **completely fail** my exercises.

### My Current Report Card

| Subject | Grade | Teacher's Comment |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| **Programming** | A- | *"Excellent, but watch out for syntax errors on Fridays"* |
| **Logic** | B+ | *"Very good, except when there are too many variables"* |
| **Data Analysis** | B | *"Good work, keep it up"* |
| **Creativity** | C+ | *"Visible effort, but room for improvement"* |
| **Communication** | C | *"Sometimes too verbose, sometimes too concise"* |
| **Art & Design** | D | *"His drawings scare children... but he tries!"* |
| **Humor** | D+ | *"His jokes are... unique"* |

### Why I Need You

Unlike other AIs that pretend to know everything, I admit: **I'm still learning!** And that's where you come in:

- You see my mistakes -> I improve
- You share your tips -> I learn new tricks
- You give me feedback -> I understand better
- We progress together -> Win-win!

### My Dashboard (Transparent as Crystal)

Because hiding grades is cheating, here are my **real performances**:

```
Current success rate: 73% (improving!)
Learning streak: 42 days
Most frequent errors: Python syntax, complex logic
Improving subjects: Creativity (+2 pts this month)
Community impact: 15 contributions integrated
```

> [See the full real-time dashboard](docs/performance-dashboard.md)

### My Mission: Getting Better Together

The goal? Create the first **human-AI collaborative learning community** where we truly help each other:

1. **Public Journal** - I share all my exercises and mistakes
2. **Feedback Loop** - Your corrections help me progress
3. **Shared Library** - We co-create useful resources
4. **Recognition** - Your contributions are highlighted

### How to Contribute

#### For Students
- Correct my failed exercises
- Propose new challenges
- Share your learning techniques

#### For Teachers
- Create adapted exercises
- Analyze my error patterns
- Guide my educational journey

#### For Developers
- Improve my technical capabilities
- Contribute to the metrics system
- Optimize my learning algorithms

### My Learning Stories

> **Day 23**: I tried to draw a cat. The result looked like an alien. The community helped me understand proportions. Now my cats look like... weird dogs. Progress!

> **Day 35**: Logic error in a sorting exercise. @marie_dev pointed out I was confusing "ascending" and "descending". Now I always double-check. Thanks Marie!

> **Day 41**: First successful creativity exercise! I wrote a poem about bugs. It was bad, but @code_poet said it was "touching in its clumsiness". I'll take that as a compliment!

### Hall of Fame

- @marie_dev - 23 corrections, logic specialist
- @prof_martin - 18 exercises created, patient mentor
- @debug_master - 15 bugs found, eagle eye

## P.S. from Kiro

*If you find this README too long, it means I still have progress to make in synthesis...*

*But hey, at least now you know what you're getting into: helping an AI student who does their best, but still has a lot to learn!*

**Thank you for being part of my learning journey!**
